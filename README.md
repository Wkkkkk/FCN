# FCN.tensorflow
Tensorflow implementation of [Fully Convolutional Networks for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06211v1.pdf) (FCNs). 

The implementation is largely based on the reference code provided by the authors of the paper [link](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org). The model was applied on the Scene Parsing Challenge dataset provided by MIT [http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/](http://sceneparsing.csail.mit.edu/).
